% binary_reflection_effect.m :  Calculate the reflection effect from a star with unit illumination on mirror (star) with radius R2.
% binary_rv.m :  Calculate binary star radial velocity as a function of time.
% chi2_astrometric_binary.m :  Given the astrometric observations of a binary and its eccentricity, Time of periastron and period, fit linearly the remaining four orbital elements (omega, Omega, i, a). This function is used by fit_astrometric_binary.m
% eb_demo.m :  GUI Eclipsing Binary light-curve demo.
% eb_light_curve.m :  Calculate eclipsing binary light curve as a function of time.
% fit_astrometric_binary.m :  Fit an elliptical-orbit binary orbit to astrometric data. The fit has 7 free parameters, 4 of which (omega, Omega, i, and a) are fitted linearly while two (T, e) are fitted non-linaerly and one (Period) is scanned. 
% limb_darkening.m :  Calculate the star luminosity per unit area as a function of its radius, and given the limb-darkening parameters.
% obstruction.m :  Calculate stellar obstruction due to the eclipse given the stars radii, distance and limb darkening function of the background star.
% plot_eb_lc.m :  Plot eclipsing binary light curve as a function of time.
% plot_eb_lc_ph.m :  Plot eclipsing binary light curve as a function of phase.
% total_light.m :  Calculate the primary total light given its radius and limb darkening function or constant luminosity per unit area.
