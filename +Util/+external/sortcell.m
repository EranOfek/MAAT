function Y = sortcell(X, DIM)
% SORTCELL    Sort a cell array in ascending order.
%
% Description: SORTCELL sorts the input cell array according to the
%   dimensions (columns) specified by the user.
%
% Usage: Y = sortcell(X, DIM)
%
% Input:
%	   X: the cell array to be sorted.
%  DIM: (optional) one or more column numbers. Simply an array of one or
%       more column numbers.  The first number is the primary column on
%       which to sort. Extra column numbers may be supplied if secondary
%       sorting is required. The defuault value is 1, if no dimension
%       array is supplied.
%
% Output:
%     Y: the sorted cell array.
%
% Example:    Y = sortcell(X, [3 2])
%
% Note that this function has only been tested on mixed cell arrays
% containing character strings and numeric values.
