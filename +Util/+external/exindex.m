function arr = exindex(arr, varargin)
%EXINDEX extended array indexing
%   ARROUT = EXINDEX(ARRIN, S1, S2, ...) indexes a virtual array made by
%   extending ARRIN with zeros in all directions, using subscripts S1, S2
%   etc.
%
%   ARROUT = EXINDEX(ARRIN, S1, R1, S2, R2, ...) extends ARRIN using rule
%   R1 on the first dimension, R2 on the second dimension etc.
%
%   ARROUT = EXINDEX(ARRIN, S1, S2, ..., R) extends ARRIN using rule R on
%   every dimension.
%
%   Subscripts
%   ----------
%
%   Broadly, if V is the virtual extended array, ARROUT = V(S1, S2, ...)
%
%   The elements of the subscript arguments S1, S2 etc must be integers.
%   They need not be positive and are not restricted in any way by the size
%   of ARRIN. Logical indexing and linear indexing are not supported.
%
%   There must be at least one subscript argument for each dimension of
%   ARRIN as reported by NDIMS, except that row and column vectors may have
%   1 or 2 subscripts. A single subscript is taken to refer to the
%   dimension along which the vector lies, as in normal vector indexing.
%   Scalars require 2 subscripts. If there are more subscripts than
%   dimensions, ARRIN is taken to have trailing singleton dimensions, as in
%   normal array indexing.
%
%   The number of dimensions of ARROUT will be the number of subscript
%   arguments, though trailing singleton dimensions will, as usual, be
%   suppressed. The size of ARROUT is given by the normal Matlab rules for
%   the result of indexing into ARRIN: that is
%
%       size(ARROUT) = size( ARRIN(ones(size(S1)), ones(size(S2)), ...) )
%
%   A subscript argument may be the string ':'. This behaves like a colon
%   in ordinary subscripting: a colon for the K'th subscript stands for
%   1:size(ARRIN, K). The 'end' keyword is not supported.
%
%   Rules
%   -----
%
%   Each rule may be one of the following:
%
%   A scalar cell: ARRIN is padded with elements equal to the contents of
%   the cell. The class of the cell contents must be compatible with the
%   class of ARRIN.
%
%       If different constants are used on different dimensions, padding is
%       done in the order of the subscripts. For example, a 2D array is
%       extended first in the row index direction and then in the column
%       index direction. For all other cases, the order in which dimensions
%       are extended has no effect.
%
%   'circular': ARRIN is extended with copies of itself; i.e. V is tiled
%   with ARRIN.
%
%   'symmetric': ARRIN is extended with copies of itself with reflection at
%   its boundaries; i.e. V is tiled with [ARRIN fliplr(ARRIN);
%   flipud(ARRIN) fliplr(flipud(ARRIN))].
%
%   'replicate': ARRIN is extended by copying its border elements; i.e. an
%   element of V is equal to the nearest element of ARRIN.
%
%   If no rule is given, padding is with zeros.
%
%   Examples
%   --------
%
%   Pad a 2D matrix with K extra rows and columns with reflection on both
%   axes:
%
%       b = exindex(a, 1-k:size(a,1)+k, 1-k:size(a,2)+k, 'symmetric');
%
%   Circularly shift a 2D matrix by R rows downwards and C columns
%   rightwards:
%
%       b = exindex(a, 1-r:size(a,1)-r, 1-c:size(a,2)-c, 'circular');
%
%   Force a row or column vector to be 1024 elements long, trimming or
%   padding with zeros as necessary:
%
%       u = exindex(v, 1:1024);
%
%   The same, with a non-zero padding value:
%
%       u = exindex(v, 1:1024, {-1});   % note constant in cell
%
%   Truncate or extend all the rows of a matrix to 1024 columns:
%
%       b = exindex(a, ':', 1:1024);
%
%   Extend a 2-D array into the third dimension by copying it:
%
%       b = exindex(a, ':', ':', 1:3, 'replicate');
%
%   Pad a 1-D cell array with cells containing the empty matrix:
%
%       cellout = exindex(cellin, 0:10, {{[]}});
