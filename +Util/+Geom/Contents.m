% curvlen.m :  Calculate the length of a curve by summing the distances (sqrt[X^2+Y^2]) between successive points.
% dist_box_edge.m :  Given a rectangular box and a scalar position, calculate the distance to the nearest rectangular edge.
% dist_p2line.m :  Calculate the minimum distance in a 2-d space between a line and a point.
% plane_dist.m :  Calculate the planner distance and angle between points.
% polysort.m :  Given an (unsorted) convex polygon vertices, sort the vertices acording to their position angle as measured from the polygon center of mass.
% rotm.m :  Return a numeric or symbolic 3-D rotation matrix about the X, Y or Z axis.
% traj_mindist.m :  Given two linear trajectories in the 2-D plane (x and y position as function of time), calculate the time in which the distance between the two trajectories is minimal and the distance at that time. Each line is defined by: x_i = A_i + B_i*(t - T_i) y_i = D_i + E_i*(t - T_t)
% tri_equidist_center.m :  Find the position of a point found in equal distances from the verteces of a planer triangle.
